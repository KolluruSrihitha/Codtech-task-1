Purpose:
The code creates a simple quiz game that presents multiple-choice questions to the user, keeps track of the score, and provides feedback.

Breakdown:

Includes and Constants
#include <stdio.h>: Includes the standard input/output library for functions like printf and scanf.
#include <string.h>: Includes the string manipulation library for handling strings.
#define MAX_QUESTIONS 5: Defines a constant for the maximum number of questions.
#define MAX_OPTIONS 4: Defines a constant for the maximum number of options per question.
Structure
typedef struct { ... } Question;: Defines a structure named Question to store information about a question, including its text, options, and the correct answer index.
Functions
print_question(Question q): Takes a Question structure as input and prints the question and its options to the console.
get_user_answer(): Prompts the user to enter their answer as a number (1-4) and returns the chosen option.
main():
Creates an array of Question structures to store the quiz questions.
Initializes a score variable to keep track of correct answers.
Iterates through each question:
Prints the question using print_question.
Gets the user's answer using get_user_answer.
Checks if the user's answer is correct and provides feedback.
Updates the score if the answer is correct.
Prints the final score.
Key Points
The code uses a struct to organize question data efficiently.
Functions are used to modularize the code and improve readability.
The code could be enhanced with error handling, randomization, and more complex question formats.
